A longtine ago ,there lived a merchant with his wife in village .He used to sell salt in the neighboring places to make his livelihood.He had a donkey for this purpose.
It used to carry the bags of salt on his back and travel along with the merchant.

		The donkey was lazy.It always hated the same rotuine and boring work.It used to think that the merchant is making use of him but nerver gifted him not 
apperciated him .BUt it  was not right.The merchant always cared of it.

	One day ,both the merchant and the donkey were set on their routine travel.They were walking to the neighboring village to sell the salt.The donkey has bags of
salt on its back.It thought,"Hmm..another day began!"Both of them were slowly waling.

Then they came cross a small river that has a very narrow bridge.The merchant was talking the donkey carefully.

However ,the donkey slipped into the river and all the bags of salt were wrt by the river water.The Merchant grabbed the donkey out of the river swiftly.But beacuse of
coming in contact with water,all the salt get dissolved.Thus,the bags on the back of were the donkey were emptied.

	When it raised again,the donkey found that the bags were as light as air!It could not undersand what just happaned.On giving a little thought, it understood that
it was water that made the bag light.It jumped with joy slently.However, the merchant was sad as he lost all his salt.He, along with the donkey, then retured home with disappointment.
